# Salary-Calculation-using-Machine-Learning-with-Polynomial-Regression
Instead of just using Polynomial Regression on experience levels, incorporate AI-driven salary progression based on technology stack trends, industry demand, and future projections.
# 🚀 Salary Prediction Using Machine Learning

## 📌 Overview
Salary prediction is a challenging task due to **non-linear salary progression** based on **experience, skills, and industry trends**. This project leverages **Polynomial Regression** to accurately predict salaries based on various factors like **years of experience, tech stack, and market demand**.

## ✨ Features
- 📊 **Polynomial Regression Model** for better salary predictions
- 🔍 **Tech stack-based salary progression insights**
- 📈 **Graphical representation of salary trends**
- 🌐 **Scalable API/Web app for real-time predictions**
- 🛡️ **License:** [Apache 2.0](LICENSE) *(Recommended for protection & open collaboration)*

## 📦 Tech Stack
- **Python** 🐍 (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Flask/FastAPI)
- **Machine Learning Algorithms:** Polynomial Regression
- **Data Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 🔧 Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/PSivaMallikarjun/salary-prediction-ml.git
cd salary-prediction-ml

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🚀 Usage
```python
from salary_predictor import predict_salary

# Example usage:
predicted_salary = predict_salary(experience=5, tech_stack='Python, AI')
print(f"Predicted Salary: ${predicted_salary}")
```

## 📊 Graph Visualization
Run the following script to **generate salary trend graphs**:
```bash
python visualize_salary.py
```
